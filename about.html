    <!-- Bio -->
    <article class="">
      <h2>I chose to pursue a career in design to be an active participant in improving quality of life for people with disabilities and help make the world fit better for them.</h2>
      <p>I believe that in everything you do, you are showing someone what is possible. I have a physical disability and I am a mom...so that’s possible. I believe in mainstreaming disability. I also believe that my daughter is the awesomest human being I could possibly meet!</p>
      <p>So what else is possible? Discovering a new passion. When my previous career as a freelance video editor was going stagnant, I realized I needed a career change. I first explored Web Development and then stumbled upon UX / UI Design. It appealed to me instantly, because italigns with what I was already doing. I just love doing anything visual!</p>
